## Featured Projects

### 1. Enterprise Network Infrastructure

**Description**:  
A simulated **enterprise-sized network** implementing a **multi-layer architecture** with VLANs, Spanning Tree Protocol (STP), and dynamic routing (OSPF, EIGRP, BGP). The network consists of **Core, Distribution, and Access layers**, ensuring **high availability, security, and scalability**. The topology includes **redundancy mechanisms, security policies, and efficient traffic management** to mimic real-world enterprise environments.

**Tools Used**:  
Packet Tracer, Wireshark, OSPF, EIGRP, BGP, STP, ACLs, DHCP, VLANs  

### Network Architecture

- **Core Layer**: High-speed core switches (CSW1 & CSW2) providing backbone connectivity.  
- **Distribution Layer**: Layer 3 distribution switches (DSW-A1, DSW-A2, DSW-B1, DSW-B2) for VLAN segmentation, routing, and redundancy.  
- **Access Layer**: Access switches (ASW-A1, ASW-A2, ASW-A3, ASW-B1, ASW-B2, ASW-B3) connecting end-user devices.  
- **Routing**: Central **router (R1) connects to the ISP** for external network access.  

### Protocols & Features Implemented  

- **VLANs**: Implemented for network segmentation and security.  
- **Spanning Tree Protocol (STP)**: Enabled to prevent switching loops and ensure redundancy.  
- **Inter-VLAN Routing**: Configured for internal communication between VLANs.  
- **Dynamic Routing Protocols**:  
  - **OSPF** for efficient intra-domain routing.  
  - **EIGRP** for internal routing between enterprise subnets.  
  - **BGP** to manage external network traffic and ISP connectivity.  
- **DHCP**: Automated IP address assignment for end devices.  
- **ACLs**: Configured for traffic filtering and network security.  

### Network Troubleshooting & Analysis

- **Simulated Network Issues**:  
  - VLAN misconfigurations causing connectivity failures.  
  - Routing protocol inconsistencies affecting path selection.  
  - STP loops and broadcast storms in case of redundant links.  
- **Troubleshooting Tools & Steps**:  
  - **Wireshark** for packet analysis.  
  - **Ping & Traceroute** for network path verification.  
  - **Show Commands (`show vlan`, `show ip route`, etc.)** for debugging misconfigurations.
